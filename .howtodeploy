HOW TO DEPLOY TO PROD?
    Duplicate the project file first (for backup purposes if something went wrong in the prod deployment)

    Select the copy of the project as the deployment target
        Set up .env file to production:
            App config
                ...APP_ENV=production
            Database config
                ...Hosting DB Setups

        Clear cache:
            Paste in terminal and run:
                php artisan view:clear
                php artisan cache:clear
                php artisan config:clear
                php artisan route:clear

        Run in terminal:
            composer install --optimize-autoloader --no-dev
            npm run build

        Compress the project file into a ZIP file (copy version)
